I've had a lot of trouble with this project and have been unable to complete it. I was unable to deploy on Heroku and unable to debug errors where my style sheet was not linking. 

I have managed to complete a couple of the smaller features 
- Functional login and log out buttons
- Create Account functionality, so a new user can sign up to be an author.
- Show/Hide the relevant information and buttons based on whether the user is logged in/out 
- Enable/Disable the relevant features based on whether the user is logged in/out 

- I attempted to create the image url in the create a story field but was unable to get this working embedded in the code so it is still pulling from the place holders. 

I have attached a folder titled 'screenshots'of how this all looks locally.
